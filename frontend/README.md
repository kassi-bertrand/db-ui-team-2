# Overview

Welcome in the frontend side of the event planner project. This `README.md` is to help my
teammates, and any potential visitors understand the work being done on the frontend, and
how it is organized. This side of the project was was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

```
```

## How to run the frontend?

In this directory, you can either run:

### `npm start`

This command will runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
