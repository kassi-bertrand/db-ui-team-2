# Contributing

As the best always come from team efforts, contributions are welcomed ❤️ ! The following guide describes guidelines and processes explained by TA [Hayden Center](https://github.com/HaydenCenter) to follow throughout the semester when interacting with this codebase, for consistency-purposes. The following document is also meant to serve as a reference for team, moving forward.

# How to start 🚀

Before making your contributions, whether for the frontend or the backend, you need to have this repository stored in your computer.

- Navigate to your prefered directory, run the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/kassi-bertrand/db-ui-team-2.git
```

## Frontend

If you're on the UI part of the team:

1. Get into the repository's directory:

```sh
cd db-ui-team-2
```

2. Run the following command, to download the required packages on your local machine:

## Backend

## Implementing Issues

As you know, the project is spread over the course of four(4) sprints. Each sprint has a target number of user stories to implement. For clarity purposes, each sprint have its own dedicated branch. For instance, the Sprint 1 branch is named `sprint_1`.

So, to implement an issue (i.e. user story), on your local machine, please make sure:

1. _*To be on the correct branch*_, using the following command:

```sh
git switch branch_name
```

_Note: If the branch does not exit yet, please create one on GitHub, following this format: `sprint_n` ... where `n` is the sprint number, then run the following command in your terminal `git pull`_

2. _*Create new feature branch off of the sprint branch*_. On this branch you'll implement the user story(i.e. user story).
